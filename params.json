While we plan to keep this repo current, there is no support for it from Rustici Software. Feel free to ask questions and post issues, but the priority will typically be low.\r\n\r\nThis SDK code should work fine on iOS 5+ and OS X as well, but it is new code and will rely on the community for most of the testing. Please open an issue if you find something a little off.\r\n\r\n[TinCanObjC Wiki and Sample Code](https://github.com/RusticiSoftware/TinCanObjC/wiki)","google":"UA-40567136-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
